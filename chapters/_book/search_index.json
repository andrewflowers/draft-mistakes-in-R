Its idiosyncrasies can be a source of deep frustration for beginners. But I’d argue there is no better tool for data analysis. That’s why I’ve written this free ebook How To Make Mistakes In R for O’Reilly. It’s modeled after the excellent How To Make Mistakes In Python, by Mike Pirnat. The target audience is all R programmers, from those just starting out all the way to the advanced developers. It’ll cover mistakes in setup, silly things, style no-no’s, statistics – and other surprises, too. I’m especially qualified to write this book because I’ve made so many R mistakes in my own work. 1.0.1 R is great for data science The focus of this book is not programming in R as much as it is using R for data science. This is what where R is at its best: interactively exploring and analyzing data. "]
