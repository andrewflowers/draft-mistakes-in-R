### How To Make Mistakes in R?
 
# R is great, but it's also weird
 
R was built by and for statisticians, so it’s not like other programming languages. Its idiosyncrasies can be a source of deep frustration for beginners. But I’d argue there is no better tool for data analysis.

That’s why I’ve written this free ebook **How To Make Mistakes In R** for O’Reilly. It’s modeled after the excellent [**How To Make Mistakes In Python**](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/how-to-make-mistakes-in-python.csp), by [Mike Pirnat](http://mike.pirnat.com/).

The target audience is all R programmers, from those just starting out all the way to the advanced developers. It’ll cover mistakes in set-up, style, and statistics – and other surprises, too. I’m especially qualified to write this book because I’ve made so many R mistakes in my own work.
